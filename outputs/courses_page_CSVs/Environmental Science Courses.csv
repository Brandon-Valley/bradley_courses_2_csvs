ENS 110,Environmental Science,3,,"MI,NS",Students with credit for BIO 300 may not enroll in ENS 110,"This course examines the science and social implications of environment.  Emphasis will be on basic science, social, economic and political implications of human interactions with natural systems and understanding environmental issues and sustainable resource use."
ENS 150,Introduction to Environmental Science,2,,,ENS major,"Introduces Environmental Science  majors to critical concepts in Environmental Science Fields focusing on broad topics such as hypothesis testing, library research, and ethics in science. Exposes students to ENS concentration areas (biology, physics and chemistry) focusing specifically on how these areas are integral to problem solving in environmental science."
ENS 305,Sustainability and Food,3,,NS,"Junior or senior standing, or sophomores by permission of instructor",Introduction to how the concept of sustainability and the basic principles of evolutionary and ecological processes impact food production and distribution.
ENS 307,Science and Politics of Global Climate Change,3,,MI,Junior standing or permission of instructor,"The complex problem of global climate change will be explored by connecting knowledge and perspectives from the natural and social sciences, concentrating particularly on the links between atmospheric and terrestrial sciences and international studies/political science. Cross-listed with IS 307."
ENS 470,Environmental Science Capstone,1-3,,,Junior or Senior ENS major or consent of instructor,"This course is intended primarily as a required element of the Environmental Science Major (ENS-B, ENS-C, ENS-P) program at Bradley University.  Biology, Chemistry, and Physics majors with interest in environmental fields may find the content of interest. The course will be exceedingly challenging for students without a science background or the desire to engage in the primary scientific literature surrounding environmental issues.  The course may be repeated up to 3 hours with different topics."
