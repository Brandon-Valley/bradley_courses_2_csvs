FS,,QR,QR,,CS 100,Introduction to Programming Concepts and Languages,3,MTH 109 or higher,"An introduction to programming concepts and languages for non-Computer Science (CS) majors. Topics include the structure and design of algorithms, variables, constants, data types, arithmetic operations, selection and repetition structures, functions, input/output, arrays, structures, files, libraries. Students will design, write, test and run computer programs using a modern programming language as the development tool."
FS,,QR,QR,,CS 101,Introduction to Programming,4,MTH 109 or higher,"Introduces the fundamental concepts of programming from an object-oriented perspective. Topics include simple data types, control structures (if-else loops, switch statements), introduction to array and string data structures, algorithms, debugging and testing techniques, and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes good software engineering principles and practices, breaking the programming process into analysis, design, implementation, and testing, with primary focus on implementation and development of fundamental programming skills."
